# Blade-Coater-Alignment
Routine to determine the alignment angle in the blade-coater instrument I built as part of my doctorate work at Washington State University.

The routine works by uploading an image from inside the blading chamber and then selecting 4 points that will be used to define the edge of the blade and the edge of the substrate. Then, the angle of these lines can be determined using the dot product. You can see an example of the routine at work below.
